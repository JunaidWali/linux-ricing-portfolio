Here are some of the examples of my rices on Linux over the years.

## First attempt using the KDE Desktop Environment

I tried to make something super simple with minimal look and feel

## Second attempt was done using the Gnome desktop environment running Manjaro.

This had a Windows feel with a touch of Chrome OS.

Design specifications:<br>
Application theme: Orchis-Dark Compact<br>
Icons: Papirus Dark<br>
Shell Theme: Orchis-Dark Compact<br>


## Favourite one using KDE and Manjaro

I love this rice the best because it has the most features and is a perfect mix of Windows and Mac OS. I used Manjaro for this one as well since I felt it was the best distro for my use case.
